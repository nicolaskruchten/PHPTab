Notes on style from 2013: this program is written in what I would call 'classic PHP style' with little to no regard for security, separation of concerns or MVC or anything like that. That's how many PHP developers rolled in 2003 :) I updated this system to use Twitter Bootstrap 10 years later so I could keep using it, but didn't have the energy to fully rewrite it in a modern framework, so please treat this as the historical artifact that it is before judging the software engineering choices it embodies!

Enjoy my little program! :)
